// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

// Planing, Analysis of Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing & Integration, Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, the process of determining the user expections fir a new or modified product."
const design = "The third step, the process to transform the userrequirements into some suitable form."
const implementation = "The fourth step, the transformation of the software techinical data package into one or more fabricated, integrated, and tested software configuration items that are ready for software acceptance testing,"
const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth step, phase in the software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group."
const maintain = "The last step, the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs."
